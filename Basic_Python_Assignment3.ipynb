    "2. Functions stop us from writing the same logic various times. We can bind the logic in one def and then call the same over and over.\n",

    "**Ans:** The Python return statement is a key component of functions and methods. We can use the return statement to make functions send Python objects back to the caller code. These objects are known as the functionâ€™s return value. A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression."
