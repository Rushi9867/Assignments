    "* ‘r+’ – Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.<br>\n",
    "* ‘a’ – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file.<br>\n",
    "* ‘a+’ – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.<br>\n",

    "* whereas the readline() that will read and print out only the first characters that take up as many bytes as we specify in the parenthesis. We may want to use readline() when we are reading files that are too big for our RAM.<br>\n",

    "* The readline() function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file."

    "### 9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?\n",
    "**Ans:**  It contains key and values it represents dictionary. The Shelve Module of Python is a very popular module of Python which works like an effective tool for persistent data storage inside files using a Python program. As the name of this module suggests, i.e., Shelve, we can easily interpret that it will work as a shelf object to keep all our data inside a file and save all the necessary information. In the Shelve Module, a shelf object is defined, which acts like a dictionary-type object, and it is persistently stored in the disk file of our computer. That's how we can save all the data and information through Python Shelve Module in our system and keep it till whenever we want."
